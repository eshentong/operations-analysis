In this project, my team and I explored variables using Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Statistical Analysis such as OLS and fixed effect OLS. The data combines Board of Directors and company financial data in an attempt to explore how BOD correlates with financial measurements such as **ROA, profit margin, total revenue**, etc.

We also created a dashboard that helped us understand the correlations through visual aids [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/j7LSKTHB8tI): https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/j7LSKTHB8tI
